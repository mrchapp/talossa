WHEREAS Talossans like to celebrate things, and

WHEREAS Talossans like to commemorate things, and

WHEREAS these facts are apparent from the 21 different items currently categorised informally as "national holidays", and

WHEREAS holidays are really cool things, and

WHEREAS Talossans are not predisposed to stop proclaiming different days on which things are to be celebrated, and

WHEREAS the list of recognised celebrations makes it look like the people of this nation have a lot more days off work than they really do, and

WHEREAS the government of the Kingdom should establish and fix a list of the holidays that it shall officially recognise and on which no non-critical government business is performed, and

WHEREAS the Cestours residing in the Kingdom have existing customs concerning their work habits which should — as another act of this Kingdom's great, magnificent, and beneficent kindness toward them — be recognised and the true Talossanity of these traditions acknowledged, even if the Cestours, in their ignorance, do not do so, and

WHEREAS that's plenty of WHEREAS's, now

THEREFORE be it resolved by the Ziu of the Kingdom of Talossa, that the list of public holidays recognised and observed by the government is as follows:

Third Monday in February	Culture Day	commemorating the rich culture of the Kingdom, in line with Napoleon's Memorial Wargaming Day (which has its day of observance on 21 February), and being a traditional kick-off day for celebration of Berber Heritage Month
Final Monday in May	Cestour Day	celebrating Cestour heritage and the rich history of the protoTalossan realm, in line with Juneau Day (which has its day of observance on 28 May); celebrating the bridge-building to our Cestour residents that has been the hallmark of our nation

First Monday in September	Monarchy Day (observed)	commemorating the resumption of the Talossan monarchy with the coronation of Florence on 24 August
