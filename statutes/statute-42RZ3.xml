  <antecedent>
    <whereas>the Kingdom of Talossa has made the wise decision to recognise animals that are an integral part of our national
        consciousness through thoughtful implementation of legislation such as 40RZ19 Squirrel Appreciation Day Act, which
        designates each January 21st as a day of observance, and</whereas>
    <whereas>in seemingly every other Cosa some always ill-fated attempt (including 41RZ11: The Diet Coke of Provinces: Pengöpäts
        Amendment and 38RZ1: The Pengöpäts: Land of Fun Amendment) has been made to convert our penguin-adorned territory into a
        province, and</whereas>
    <whereas>although such attempts have consistently failed to pass the Ziu (failing even to gain the votes of their sponsors),
        the fact remains that there is clearly (or apparently, or perhaps) a desire to recognise and assist Pengöpäts in some
        manner, and</whereas>
    <whereas>there exists (although no one seems to know exactly why) a penguin-related day of observance, surprisingly close to
        the date of Squirrel Appreciation Day, and</whereas>
    <whereas>the mysterious and unexplained pre-existence of this day of observance presents an innocuous opportunity to see if
        maybe officially adding it to the Talossan calendar might quench the stubborn desire to recognise and assist Pengöpäts
        (not to mention actually facilitate the said recognition and assistance), now</whereas>
  </antecedent>
  <consequent>
    <therefore>be It Hereby Resolved That the 20th of January of each year be designated a day of observance by the Kingdom of
        Talossa, on which date shall be celebrated PENGUIN AWARENESS DAY, and</therefore>
    <furthermore>the Kingdom of Talossa shall encourage all Talossans on that day to
      <orderedlist>
        <item>pay tribute to the lives of penguins, through reflection on the existence of the order Sphenisciformes, family
            Spheniscidae, and the Territory of Pengöpäts and;</item>
        <item>visit penguins in the wild (preferably in the Territory of Pengöpäts) or at a zoo, or observe and study penguins
            through video, books, or otherwise, or to dress in penguin-y hued raiment, or to act as if they were in fact a penguin
            sometime during that day, or to use the Linux operating system in some manner, or to watch a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey
            game, or to consider the careers of third-baseman Ron Cey and actors Burgess Meredith and Danny DeVito, and</item>
        <item>support a conservation group such as SANCCOB (The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds;
            yes, how they got "SANCCOB" out of that is a mystery to us too), the Penguin Foundation, or their local zoo.</item>
