<act xml:lang="en" identifier="41RZ7" rubric="The Anti-Un-Renunciation Amendment">
  <antecedent>
    <whereas>a Talossan citizen who renounces his or her citizenship currently has 24 hours after the said renunciation is
        acknowledged by the Secretary of State before the citizenship is officially lost, and</whereas>
    <whereas>this period of time has been the cause of much agony for the citizens of the Kingdom, either in panicked acts to talk
        the renouncing citizen out of their decision, and/or in watching the citizen change his or her mind repeatedly about such
        a serious step, and</whereas>
    <whereas>Talossan citizenship is the best thing money cannot buy, and</whereas>
    <whereas>to renounce such a thing is a serious matter and should be given serious consideration long before posting about it,
        and</whereas>
    <whereas>especially given legislation that will make the re-entry of former citizens less of an ordeal, providing that former
        citizens are always eligible to return to the Kingdom should they choose to re-apply for citizenship, now</whereas>
  </antecedent>
  <consequent>
